## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìã Prerequisites Checklist

Before diving into CCRM, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+** installed and configured
- [ ] **Terminal/Command Prompt** access
- [ ] **Basic understanding** of command-line interfaces
- [ ] **Sample data files** (included in `test-data/` directory)

### ‚ö° Quick Setup

#### Step 1: Compile the Application

<details>
<summary><b>ü™ü Windows Users (PowerShell/CMD)</b></summary>

```powershell
# Navigate to your CCRM directory
cd C:\path\to\CCRM

# Compile all Java source files
javac -d out -cp src src/edu/ccrm/config/AppConfig.java src/edu/ccrm/cli/CCRM.java src/edu/ccrm/model/*.java src/edu/ccrm/model/enums/*.java src/edu/ccrm/model/interfaces/*.java src/edu/ccrm/model/value/*.java src/edu/ccrm/exceptions/*.java src/edu/ccrm/service/*.java

# Verify compilation (should show no errors)
echo "Compilation completed successfully!"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üêß Linux/macOS Users (Terminal)</b></summary>

```bash
# Navigate to your CCRM directory
cd /path/to/CCRM

# Compile all Java source files
find src -name "*.java" | xargs javac -d out

# Verify compilation (should show no errors)
echo "Compilation completed successfully!"
```

</details>

#### Step 2: Launch the Application

```bash
# Run with assertions enabled (recommended for development)
java -ea -cp out edu.ccrm.cli.CCRM

# Alternative: Run without assertions (production mode)
java -cp out edu.ccrm.cli.CCRM
```

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

When the application starts, you should see:

```
Java Platforms: ME (embedded), SE (standard), EE (enterprise). Running SE.
JDK Version: 17.0.x
JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM

## Business Rules

### Enrollment Rules
- Maximum 18 credits per semester per student
- Students cannot enroll in the same course twice in the same semester
- Only active students can enroll in courses
- Only active courses can be enrolled in

### Grading Rules
- Grades are calculated from percentage scores (0-100)
- Letter grades: A+ (97+), A (93-96), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (60-66), F (<60)
- Incomplete (I) and Withdrawal (W) grades do not count toward GPA
- GPA is calculated as weighted average of grade points

## Error Handling

### Common Exceptions
- **DuplicateEnrollmentException**: Student already enrolled in course
- **MaxCreditLimitExceededException**: Student exceeds credit limit
- **IllegalArgumentException**: Invalid input parameters
- **IOException**: File I/O errors

### Error Recovery

- **Builder**: Course creation with optional parameters
- **Strategy**: Different search and sort strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Compilation Issues
- Ensure JDK 17+ is installed and on PATH
- Check that all source files are in correct package structure
- Verify classpath includes all dependencies

### Runtime Issues
- Enable assertions with `-ea` flag
- Check file permissions for data directory
- Ensure CSV files are properly formatted

### Performance Considerations
- Large datasets may require increased heap size
- Use `-Xmx` flag for memory-intensive operations
- Consider data pagination for very large result sets

## Best Practices

### Data Management
- Regular backups of important data
- Validate input data before processing
- Use transactions for related operations

### Code Organization
- Follow package naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Include comprehensive error handling

### Testing
- Test with sample data before production use
- Verify business rule enforcement
- Test error conditions and edge cases
